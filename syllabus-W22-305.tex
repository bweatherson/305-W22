\hypertarget{course-description}{%
\section{Course Description}\label{course-description}}

This course will introduce some important formal tools that are used
elsewhere in philosophy. We will look at propositional logic,
probability theory and the logic of modals and conditionals. Obviously
that's a lot to cover in a short time - the aim here is to make sure you
understand the basics, and the symbolism, so you can follow simple
applications of these tools, and you have the foundations to understand
more complicated applications.

\hypertarget{canvas}{%
\section{Canvas}\label{canvas}}

There is a Canvas site for this course, which can be accessed from
\url{https://canvas.umich.edu}. Course documents (syllabus, lecture
notes, assignments) will be available from this site. Please make sure
that you can access this site. Consult the site regularly for
announcements, including changes to the course schedule. And there are
many tools on the site to communicate with each other, and with me.

\hypertarget{required-materials}{%
\section{Required Materials}\label{required-materials}}

There are three textbooks for the course. All of them are open access,
and hence free. The third is on Canvas, the other two have to be
downloaded from elsewhere.

\hypertarget{course-requirements}{%
\section{Course Requirements}\label{course-requirements}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  There will be 12 weekly quizzes. Of these your best 10 will count
  towards your grade, with each counting for 8\%.
\item
  There will also be a final exam, given through Canvas, that counts for
  20\% of the grade.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{summary-of-grading-system}{%

\item
  Weekly assignments - 8\% each, 10 assignments count, 80\% total.
\item
  Final exam - 20\%.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{plagiarism}{%
\section{Plagiarism}\label{plagiarism}}

Although team-work, and even co-authorship, is encouraged, plagiarism is
strictly prohibited. You are responsible for making sure that none of
your work is plagiarized. Be sure to cite work that you use, both direct
quotations and paraphrased ideas. Any citation method that is tolerably
clear is permitted, but if you'd like a good description of a citation
scheme that works well in philosophy, look at
\url{http://bit.ly/VDhRJ4}.

You are encouraged to discuss the course material, including
assignments, with your classmates, but all written work that you hand in
under your own name must be your own. If work is handed is as the work
of two people, you are affirming that each person did a fair share of
the work. (Note that when you're submitting work on Canvas, you have to
each submit the paper, even if it is co-authored. That way Canvas knows
that everyone has turned in work.)

You should also be familiar with the academic integrity policies of the
College of Literature, Science \& the Arts at the University of
Michigan, which are available here:
\url{http://www.lsa.umich.edu/academicintegrity/}. Violations of these
policies will be reported to the Office of the Assistant Dean for
Student Academic Affairs, and sanctioned with a course grade of F.

\hypertarget{disability}{%
\section{Disability}\label{disability}}

The University of Michigan abides by the Americans with Disabilities Act
of 1990, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and other
applicable federal and state laws that prohibit discrimination on the
basis of disability, which mandate that reasonable accommodations be
provided for qualified students with disabilities.

If you have a disability, and may require some type of instructional
and/or examination accommodation, please contact me early in the
semester. If you have not already done so, you will also need to
register with the Office of Services for Students with Disabilities. The
office is located at G664 Haven Hall.

For more information on disability services at the University of
Michigan, go to \url{http://ssd.umich.edu}.

\newpage

\hypertarget{class-schedule}{%
\section{Class Schedule}\label{class-schedule}}

The readings will all be from the three textbooks. I've produced short
videos going over the material in the books, and occasionally other
philosophically interesting points. Then the time in class will be
entirely spent on questions people have, and going over worked examples.
So you should do the reading, and watch the lectures, before the
scheduled class.

Most of the readings are from the two textbooks. The other readings are
all in the UM library or online. You might have to be logged in to UM to
get them though. The names of the papers are links to a source where you
can get a copy of the paper.

The video lectures will have a number of the form \(x.y\), where \(x\)
is the week they are for, and the \(y\) is their order in the week. You
should watch these \textbf{before} class, and we can discuss the
material in class.

Most weeks have a fairly simple structure. There are in person classes
with me on Tuesday and Thursday, and you have a smaller in person class
with Mica as well. There are video lectures before each of my classes.
And at the end of the week there is a Canvas quiz assigned about the
material we covered. But there are exceptions, especially around late
January-early February. I'm going to be away on \textbf{January 27}, and
that leads to the following complications.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  There is no in person class with me on Thursday, January 27.
\item
  The assignment due January 28 will just be about the material through
  class on Tuesday, January 25.
\item
  There will be no assignment due the following week, i.e., on February
  4. I want to make sure you've got plenty of time to cover the material
  in week 5, which is a bit harder than the rest of the course.
\item
  The assignment in week 6 will be about the material through class on
  Thursday, February 3.
\item
  The assignment in week 7 will cover the material in weeks 6 and 7.
\end{itemize}

The week after Spring Break is also going to be a bit different. This
will be less problems based and more about the philosophical
significance of some of the work we're doing here. There isn't an
assignment that week, and it quite literally isn't on the test. But I
hope you'll get something out of it, because I think understanding this
material is important for understanding a lot of what goes on in
contemporary academic work. Anyway, there is no assignment that week.
