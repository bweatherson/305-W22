Hello, and welcome to Philosophy 305 - Introduction to Formal Methods

Lecture 2.6 - Building Complicated Truth Tables

<new slide>

This lecture is going to go over how to build truth tables for more complicated sentences. 

<new slide>

This is all in chapters 10 and 11 of for all x.

<new slide>

Here's the example we're going to use. It's a slightly complicated sentence, but let's try briefly saying in English what it says.

If either A or not B, then if B, then A and C.

OK, I don't really know what that means just by looking at it, so let's start putting it through the truth table machine.

<new slide>

First question, how many rows should this table have? Think about it for a second before going onto the next slide.

OK, done thinking?

<new slide>

It should have 8. There are three different atomic sentences involved: A, B and C. And the rule is that you have 2 to the power k rows, where k is the number of sentences. So here you have 2 cubed, i.e., 8, rows.

<new slide>

Here's the convention for how we lay out the rows. There is a sort of pattern to this, especially if you naturally think in terms of binary arithmetic. But it's helpful to just know the convention.

We start from the left.

And the atomic sentence we put on the left, we put Ts in the top half of the rows, then Fs in the bottom half.

<new slide>

That's what I've done here. Half of 8 is 4, and there are 8 rows total, so I've put T into 4 of them, and F into the next 4.

<new slide>

Then in the next column, a quarter of the rows get T, then a quarter get F, then another quarter get T, and finally the last quarter get F.

<new slide>

Here's how that works out for the column under B. A quarter of 8 is 2, so all those rules about quarters mean that we get 2 Ts then 2 Fs and so on down the table.

<new slide>

So the pattern is that we're alternating a bucket of Ts followed by the same size bucket of Fs, then the same size bucket of Ts, etc.

The buckets get half as large every time you move across a column. So in the first column, they are each half the size of the table. Then they are a quarter the size, then an eighth, and so on.

<new slide>

Or, you know, you could just remember that this is the table for the truth table with three atomics, and be grateful that in this course we won't do the 16, 32, 64 etc line tables.

<new slide>

OK, back to the sentence. The first thing we need to do is work out what's the main connective of the sentence? What's the connective such that it, plus the sentences that feed into it, make up the whole sentence?

<new slide>

Answer, it's the first arrow. The sentence is a conditional, and the left hand side of the conditional is A or not B, and the right hand side is If B, then A and C.

<new slide>

When we're done, the truth value for the whole sentence, the thing we care about, will be under this first arrow.

But we're a long way from that. We build these tables from the inside out, so we have to start with the atomic sentences.

<new slide>

All I've done here is copy the truth values from the left hand columns over to the right hand side.

What can we do next? What do we have enough information to already fill in?

<new slide>

Well, we have the truth values for B, so we can figure out the truth values for Not B. 

And we have both A, and C, so we can work out the truth values for the conjunction A-and-C.

<new slide>

We'll start with Not B. Whenever B is true, Not B is false. That's what I've filled in here.

<new slide>

And whenever B is False, Not B is True. So we can fill in the truth value for Not B in those rows as well. And we're done with that column.

We could have simply said that the truth value for Not B is the opposite of the truth value for B, and filled in the whole column that way.

<new slide>

Let's move on to the column for the conjunction A and C.

Whenever A and C are both true, so is the conjunction A and C. And that's what is filled in here.

<new slide>

The conjunction is false everywhere else, so we can write Fs in the other six rows.

<new slide>

Now here's an important step. From now on we're working out the truth value of complex sentences that have at least one complex part. And we do exactly the same thing as we've been doing.

But here's the thing we have to be careful about. We have to remember at each stage precisely what the inputs are. So if we're working out the truth value for A-or-not-B, the inputs are the column for A, and the column for Not B. That's what we have to focus on.

And in this case, it turns out not to be too hard to focus on them.

<new slide>

Why? Well, because the truth values for A, and for Not B, are just immediately either side of where we'll write the truth value for A-or-Not-B.

So let's get under way. Whenever A is true, so is A or anything. So we can put Ts in the top four rows.

<new slide>

And if Not B is true, so is A or Not B. So the T's under Not B in rows 7 and 8 mean that we can also put Ts under A or Not B in rows 7 and 8.

<new slide>

But that's all the cases that provide a T for the disjunction. So the remaining rows get Fs.

<new slide>

Now for the conditional B arrow A and C.

Remember, a conditional is false in just one case: the left hand side is true, and the right hand side is false. Otherwise, it's true.

<new slide>

And it will help to be able to use antecedent and consequent rather than left hand side and right hand side of the conditional.

<new slide>

OK, I'll do this row by row for a few rows, but not through all 8.

In row 1, we have a true antecedent - B is true, and a true consequent, A and C is true, so we have a true conditional.

<new slide>

In row 2, we have a true antecedent - B is still true, but a false consequent, since A and C is false, so we have a false conditional.

<new slide>

In row 3, we have a false antecedent - B is now false, an a true consequent. So the whole conditional is true.

<new slide>

In row 4, both antecedent and consequent are false, so the conditional is true.

<new slide>

Row 5 is just like row 2. B is true, so it's a true antecedent, but the consequent is false. So the whole conditional is false.

<new slide>

Exactly the same thing happens in row 6.

<new slide>

But in rows 7 and 8, B is false, so it's a false antecedent, so the whole conditional is true.

<new slide>

OK, we've done just about everything. We now need to put the parts of the conditional together.

The key thing is to remember what the parts of our big conditional are, and where their truth value lives in the table.

For the antecedent, we need the column under the vee, the or-symbol, in A or Not B.

For the consequent, we need the column under the arrow, the if symbol, in B arrow A and C.

<new slide>

I've put these columns in blue to make them clearer.

<new slide>

Again, let's go through this a bit one by one. And I'll put the answers in red because we want to build the Big Red Column.

So on row 1 we have T on both sides of the conditional, so the whole thing is T.

<new slide>

Row 2 has T on the left, and F on the right, so the whole thing is F. That's the only failure case for the conditional remember - true antecedent and false consequent.

<new slide>

Row 3, like row 1, has T each side of the conditional.

<new slide>

So does Row 4.

<new slide>

Rows 5 and 6 have F on the left, and F on the right. So that's the last line of the canonical truth table for arrow, and it's a T.

<new slide>

And finally the last two lines have F on the left, and F on the right, so they are also True.

<new slide>

So there is only one possibility for the sentence to be False. A and B are both True, and C is false.

<new slide>

That's more than enough for this lecture. Next time, we'll start on how we can use truth tables in determining validity.
