## Plan

This lecture finishes our discussion of truth tables by looking some properties validity has in the truth table system.

## Associated Reading

forall x, chapter 12, sections 12.5-12.7.

## The Rules

- An argument is **invalid** if there is a row on the truth table where all the premises are true and the conclusion is false. (Roughly!)
- It is **valid** if all the rows where the premises are all true, the conclusion is true as well.

## A Relevance Failure

Is this argument valid?

&nbsp;
:    $A$

$\therefore$
:    B $\vee \neg B$

\pause

Yes! 

- There is no line where the conclusion is false.
- So there are no lines where the premise is true and the conclusion false.
- So it is not invalid, i.e., it is valid.

## Terminology

Say a **valuation** is a function $v$ from sentences to $\{\True, \False\}$ satisfying these constraints.

1. $v(\neg A) = \True$ if $v(A) = \False$, and $v(\neg A) = \False$ otherwise.
2. $v(A \vee B) = \True$ if $V(A) = \True$ or $v(B) = \True$, and $v(A \vee B) = \False$ otherwise.
3. $v(A \wedge B) = \True$ if $V(A) = \True$ and $v(B) = \True$, and $v(A \wedge B) = \False$ otherwise.
4. $v(A \rightarrow B) = \True$ if $V(A) = \False$ or $v(B) = \True$, and $v(A \rightarrow B) = \False$ otherwise.

## Restating

> - An argument is valid relative to a class of valuations $V$ iff any valuation $v \in V$ that makes all the premises $\True$ also makes the conclusion $\True$.
> - An argument is truth functionally valid when the class $V$ is the class of valuations satisfying the constraints on the previous slide.

## Very Technical Terminology

- I'll use $\Gamma \vDash A$ to mean that the argument with premises $\Gamma$ and conclusion $A$ is valid in this sense - i.e., all valuations that make all of $\Gamma$ come out $\True$ also make $A$ come out $\True$.
- The double bar in $\vDash$ is to represent that this is a kind of validity defined in terms of valuations (or, as we'll start calling them, models), and not proofs.
- For purposes of 305, the difference between $\vdash$ and $\vDash$ is not important, and if this is the last logic/mathematical philosophy course you plan to take, you don't have to worry about this.
- But I like being pedantic even when it isn't relevant to the course.

## Closure

> If $\Gamma \vDash A$ and $\Gamma \vDash A \rightarrow B$ then $\Gamma \vDash B \pause$.

Proof: Assume this is false. So assume that $\Gamma \nvDash B$. So there is a valuation function $v$ that makes everything in $\Gamma$ come out $\True$ and $B$ come out $\False \pause$. Either $v(A) = \True$ or $v(A) = \False \pause$. If $v(A) = \True$, then $v(A \rightarrow B) = \False$, contradicting $\Gamma \vDash A \rightarrow B \pause$. If $v(A) = \False$, then $v$ is a counterexample to $\Gamma \vDash A$, but we know $\Gamma \vDash A$ is true. Either way, such a $v$ cannot exist, so $\Gamma \vDash B$ is true.

## Monotony

> If $\Gamma \vDash A$, and $\Gamma \subset \Delta$, then $\Delta \vDash A$.

That is, adding premises can't turn an argument from being valid to invalid.

## Monotony Proof

- Assume that for all $B \in \Delta, v(B) = \True$.
- We need to prove that $v(A) = \True$.\pause
- Assume $C \in \Gamma$.
- Then $C \in \Delta$, since $\Gamma \subset \Delta$.\pause
- So by hypothesis, $v(C) = \True$, since everything in $\Delta$ is $\True$.\pause
- So $v$ is such that everything in $\Gamma$ is $\True$.\pause
- And since $\Gamma \vDash A$, that implies $v(A) = \True$, as required.

## Monotony Commentary

- This idea, that adding premises doesn't destroy validity, only works for logical arguments.
- It isn't true for good arguments in general.

## Tweety the First


&nbsp;
:     Tweety is a bird.

$\therefore$
:     Tweety flies.

That's a perfectly good, though not logically valid, argument.

## Tweety the Second

&nbsp;
:     Tweety is a bird.

&nbsp;
:     Tweety is black and white, lives in Antarctica, and lays large eggs.

$\therefore$
:     Tweety flies.

That's not a very good argument!

## Transitivity

> If $\Gamma \vDash A$ and $\Delta \cup A \vDash B$ then $\Gamma \cup \Delta \vDash B$

If some premises entail $A$, and some other premises plus $A$ entail $B$, then the two sets of premises between them entail $B$. \pause This is crucial for being able to chain together lines of reasoning.

## Transitivity Proof

- Assume that for all $C \in \Gamma \cup \Delta, v(C) = \True$.
- We need to prove $v(B) = \True$.\pause
- Since everything in $\Gamma$ is $\True$ according to $v$, and $\Gamma \vDash A$, it follows that $v(A) = \True$.\pause
- Since everything in $\Delta$ is $\True$ according to $v$, and $A$ is $\True$ according to $v$, and $\Delta \cup A \vDash B$, it follows that $v(B) = \True$, as required.

## Deduction Theorem

This is why we define $\rightarrow$ the way we do.

> $\Gamma \vDash A \rightarrow B$ if and only if $\Gamma \cup A \vDash B$.

Note that there are two claims here - one each direction. We need to prove each.

## Deduction Theorem Left-to-Right

- Assume $\Gamma \vDash A \rightarrow B$, and prove $\Gamma \cup A \vDash B$.
- So assume $v(C) = \True$ for all $C \in \Gamma$, and $v(A) = \True$, and aim to prove $v(B) = \True$.\pause
- Since $\Gamma \vDash A \rightarrow B$ and $v(C) = \True$ for all $C \in \Gamma$, it follows that $v(A \rightarrow B) = \True$.\pause
- Since $v(A \rightarrow B) = \True$ and $v(A) = \True$, it must be that $v(B) = \True$, since that's the only line on the truth table where $A \rightarrow B$ and $A$ are both $\True$.

## Deduction Theorem Right-to-Left

- Assume that $\Gamma \cup A \vDash B$, and prove $\Gamma \vDash A \rightarrow B$.
- So assume $v(C) = \True$ for all $C \in \Gamma$, and prove $v(A \rightarrow B) = \True$. \pause
- Either $v(A) = \True$ or $v(A) = \False$. Take each case in turn.\pause
- If $v(A) = \True$, then since $v(C) = \True$ for all $C \in \Gamma$, and $\Gamma \cup A \vDash B$, it follows that $v(B) = \True \pause$, so $v(A \rightarrow B) = \True \pause$.
- If $v(A) = \False$, it follows directly that $v(A \rightarrow B) = \True \pause$.
- Either way, $v(A \rightarrow B) = \True$ as required.

## Deduction Theorem Comments

- This is a striking result.
- It shows that proving $A \rightarrow B$ is just the same as proving $B$, assuming you're allowed to add $A$ as an extra assumption.
- And that's a good thing, intuitively. That is how we prove conditionals.
- But it only works if you have the (very odd looking) truth table that we're using for $\rightarrow$.
- This is the main reason for thinking, despite it's odd appearance, that this truth table is the right one for $\rightarrow$.

## For Next Time

We will start working on a different way to analyse arguments: truth trees.
