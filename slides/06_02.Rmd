## Plan

- This lecture looks at some general features of probability functions, and looks at some ways to think probabilistically about real world events.

## Associated Reading

Odds and Ends, Chapter 5

## Scale

$$
0 \leq \Pr(A) \leq 1
$$

## Negation

$$
\Pr(\neg A) = 1 - \Pr(A)
$$

## Excluded Middle

$$
\Pr(A) + \Pr(\neg A) = 1
$$

## Partition

Some events $A_1, \dots A_n$ form a partition if, necessarily, exactly one of them is true.

- So they are **exclusive** - you can't have any two of them both be true.
- And they are **exhaustive** - you have to have at least one true.

## Partition

If $A_1, \dots A_n$ form a partition then

$$
\Pr(A_1) + \dots + \Pr(A_n) = 1
$$

## Exclusive

If $A, B$ are exclusive

$$
\Pr(A \vee B) = \Pr(A) + \Pr(B)
$$

## General Principle

$$
\Pr(A) + \Pr(B) = \Pr(A \vee B) + \Pr(A \wedge B)
$$

\pause

It's worth thinking through why this is true in terms of possibilities.

## For Next Time

We'll look at the use of truth trees to estimate probabilities.
