## Plan

- To introduce a key new concept: **conditional probability**.

## Associated Reading

Odds and Ends, Chapter 6

## What it is

- Sometimes we don't just care about how likely something is.
- We care about how likely it is given some other thing has happened or will happen. \pause
- This might be because we want to plan. \pause
- It might be because we want to compute overall probabilities. \pause
- Or it might be because we've found something out, and want to know what it means for other likelihoods.

## Prior Examples

We've already used some conditional probabilities.

- We already talked, for example, about the probability of the Fireflies winning conditional on them being in the final against the Bluebirds.

## Inverting

But there are other questions we might want to ask as well.

> - E.g., conditional on the Fireflies winning, how likely is it that they played the Huskies.

## Intuitions

This isn't an easy question to answer intuitively.

- It is more likely that the Huskies will be actually in the final - because they are the better team.
- But it is more likely that the Fireflies will win against the Bluebirds - because they are weaker.
- It isn't always easy to intuitively balance these forces.

## Formula

$$
\Pr(A | B) = \frac{Pr(A \wedge B)}{Pr(B)}
$$

\pause

- The left-hand side means "The probability of $A$ given $B$." \pause
- And the right-hand side says that this is equal to the probability of $A \wedge B$ divided by the probability of $B$.

## Fireflies

$$
\Pr(HR | FC) = \frac{\Pr(HR \wedge FC)}{\Pr(FC)}
$$

That is, the probability that the Huskies are runners-up ($HR$) given that the Fireflies are champions ($FC$), is given by the formula on the right.

## Fireflies

$$
\Pr(HR | FC) = \frac{0.26}{0.26+0.116} = \frac{0.26}{0.376} \approx 0.691
$$

So conditional on the Fireflies winning, it's just under 70% likely they beat the Huskies.

## Updating

We are going to mostly assume that this philosophical claim is true.

$$
\Pr{}_B(A) = \Pr(A | B)
$$

The way to read that is saying that the unconditional probability of $A$ after learning $B$ equals the conditional probability of $A$ given $B$. This claim - and it is a philosophical claim not a mathematical one - is a big part of why we care about conditional probability.

## For Next Time

We're going to talk about when it is that two events are independent.
