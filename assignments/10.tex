\hypertarget{question-1}{%
\subsection{Question 1}\label{question-1}}

Youʼre considering downloading a new game for your phone. The game costs
\$0.99. But as a promotion, the first 50,000 downloaders are being
entered in a fair lottery with a \$10,000 cash prize. If you know youʼll
be one of the first 50,000 downloaders, what is the expected monetary
value of downloading the game?

\hypertarget{question-2}{%
\subsection{Question 2}\label{question-2}}

A local casino offers a game which costs \$2 to play. A fair coin is
flipped up to three times, and the payouts work as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If the coin lands heads on the first toss, you win \$2 and the game is
  over.
\item
  If the coin lands heads on the second toss, you win \$4 and the game
  is over.
\item
  If the coin lands heads on the third toss, you win \$8 and the game is
  over.
\item
  If the coin lands tails all three times, you win \$0.
\end{itemize}

What is the expected monetary value of the game?

\hypertarget{question-3}{%
\subsection{Question 3}\label{question-3}}

Suppose you can bet on either of two dogs: Santaʼs Little Helper or
Sheʼs the Fastest. If you bet on Santaʼs Little Helper and he wins, you
get \$5. If he loses you pay \$2. If you bet on Sheʼs the Fastest and
she loses, you pay \$10. The two dogs have the same chance of winning.
How much would a winning bet on Sheʼs the Fastest have to pay for the
bets to have the same value? (Assume one or other of the dogs is
guaranteed to win).

\hypertarget{question-4}{%
\subsection{Question 4}\label{question-4}}

Suppose Michigan is deciding whether to enact a new tax. If the tax is
enacted, it will bring in \$700 million in revenue.

But it could also hurt the economy. The chance of harm to the economy is
small, just 1/5. But it would cost the country \$1,200 million in lost
earnings. (The \$700 million in revenue would still be gained, partially
offsetting this loss.)

Treat gains as positive and losses as negative.

What is the expected monetary value of enacting the new tax?

(Answer in millions of dollars. So if the answer is \$700 million, write
700.)

\hypertarget{question-5}{%
\subsection{Question 5}\label{question-5}}

Extend question 4 in the following way. The government has the option of
conducting a study before deciding whether to enact the new tax. If the
study's findings are bad news, that means the chance of harm to the
economy is actually double what they thought. If its findings are good
news, then the chance of harm to the economy is actually half of what
they thought.

Suppose the government conducts the study and its findings are good
news. What will the expected monetary value of enacting the tax be then?

(Answer in millions of dollars. So if the answer is \$700 million, write
700.)

\hypertarget{question-6}{%
\subsection{Question 6}\label{question-6}}

Suppose the government conducts the study in question 5 and its findings
are bad news. What will the expected monetary value of enacting the tax
be then?

\hypertarget{question-7}{%
\subsection{Question 7}\label{question-7}}

If the expected monetary value of the tax is what you said in question
6, and the study is bound to deliver good news or bad news, what is the
probability of it delivering good news?

\hypertarget{question-8}{%
\subsection{Question 8}\label{question-8}}

Some workplaces hold a weekly lottery. Suppose there are 30 people in
your workplace lottery, and each person pays in \$5 every Monday. A
finalist is chosen at random every Friday, for three weeks. Then, on the
fourth Friday, one of the three finalists from the previous three weeks
is chosen at random. That person gets all the prize money.

What is the expected value of being in the lottery?

\hypertarget{question-9}{%
\subsection{Question 9}\label{question-9}}

Sonia has tickets to see The Weeknd tomorrow night. Her friend has
tickets to see Beyoncé, and also tickets to Katy Perry. Beyoncé is
Sonia's favourite performer, in fact she would rather see Beyoncé than
The Weeknd.

Sonia's friend offers a gamble in exchange for her tickets to The
Weeknd. The gamble has a 9/10 chance of winning, in which case Sonia
gets the Beyoncé tickets (utility 1). Otherwise she gets the Katy Perry
tickets (utility 0).

If Sonia declines the gamble, what can we conclude?

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  For Sonia, the utility of seeing The Weeknd is 9/10
\item
  For Sonia, the utility of seeing The Weeknd is greater than 9/10
\item
  For Sonia, the utility of seeing The Weeknd is less than 9/10
\item
  For Sonia, the utility of seeing The Weeknd is 1/10
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Questions 10-12}\label{questions-10-12}}

Eleanor wants to get a job at Google so she's going to university to
study computer science. She has to decide between Wayne State and
Michigan State. Suppose 1/100 of Wayne State's computer science students
get jobs at Google and the rest get jobs at Facebook. For Eleanor, a job
at Google has utility 200 while a job at Facebook has utility 50.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{11}
\tightlist
\item
  What is the expected utility of going to Wayne State for Eleanor?
\end{enumerate}

Suppose Michigan State students have better odds of getting a job at
Google: 5/400. And 360/400 students go to work at Amazon, which Eleanor
would prefer to Facebook. On the other hand, the remaining 35/400 of
them don't get a job at all, which has utility zero for Eleanor. After
thinking about it, she can't decide: Wayne State and Michigan State seem
like equally good options to her.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{12}
\tightlist
\item
  How much utility does working at Amazon have for Eleanor?
\end{enumerate}

Suppose Eleanor ends up going to Wayne State, and now she's about to
graduate. Unfortunately, Google isn't hiring any more. The only jobs
available are at Amazon and Facebook. She would have to take a special
summer training program to qualify for a job at Amazon, though. And that
would mean she can't get a job at Facebook. Facebook is offering her a
job, but she has to take it now or never. So, she has to either take the
guaranteed job at Facebook right now, or gamble on the summer program.
The summer program could get her a job at Amazon, or it could leave her
unemployed.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{13}
\tightlist
\item
  How high would the probability of getting a job at Amazon have to be
  for Eleanor to be indifferent between taking and not taking the
  special summer program?
\end{enumerate}
