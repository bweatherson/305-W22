# Chapter 5 Questions

1. What is the probability of $\neg\left(A\wedge\neg A\right)$?
2. Assume $\text{Pr}\left(A\wedge B\right)=\nicefrac{1}{3}$ and $\text{Pr}\left(A\wedge\neg B\right)=\nicefrac{1}{5}$. Say (in decimal form, to two decimal places), what is $\text{Pr}\left(\left(A\wedge B\right)\vee\left(A\wedge\neg B\right)\right)$.
3. Assume $\text{Pr}\left(A\wedge B\right)=\nicefrac{1}{3}$ and $\text{Pr}\left(A\wedge\neg B\right)=\nicefrac{1}{5}$. Say (in decimal form, to two decimal places), what is $\text{Pr}\left(A\right)$.
4. Assume $\text{Pr}\left(A\wedge B\right)=\nicefrac{1}{3}$ and $\text{Pr}\left(A\wedge\neg B\right)=\nicefrac{1}{5}$. Are $\left(A\wedge B\right)$ and $\left(A\wedge\neg B\right)$ independent?
5. Suppose $A$ and $B$ are independent, and $A$ and $C$ are mutually exclusive. Assume $\Pr(A) = \nicefrac{1}{3}, \Pr(B) = \nicefrac{1}{6}$ and $\Pr(C) = \nicefrac{1}{9}$. What (to two decimal places) is $\Pr(A \wedge C)$?
6. Suppose $A$ and $B$ are independent, and $A$ and $C$ are mutually exclusive. Assume $\Pr(A) = \nicefrac{1}{3}, \Pr(B) = \nicefrac{1}{6}$ and $\Pr(C) = \nicefrac{1}{9}$. What (to two decimal places) is $\Pr((A \wedge B) \vee C)$?
7. Suppose $A$ and $B$ are independent, and $A$ and $C$ are mutually exclusive. Assume $\Pr(A) = \nicefrac{1}{3}, \Pr(B) = \nicefrac{1}{6}$ and $\Pr(C) = \nicefrac{1}{9}$. What (to two decimal places) is $\Pr(A \wedge B)$?
8. True or False: If $\Pr(A) = \Pr(B)$ then $A$ and $B$ must be logically equivalent.
9. Consider this argument. _If a coin is fair, then the probability of getting at least one heads in a sequence of four tosses is quite high: above 90%. Therefore, if a fair coin has landed tails three times in a row, the next toss will probably land heads._ True or False: The premise of the argument is true.
10. Consider this argument. _If a coin is fair, then the probability of getting at least one heads in a sequence of four tosses is quite high: above 90%. Therefore, if a fair coin has landed tails three times in a row, the next toss will probably land heads._ True or False: The argument is valid.

## Odds and Ends 6.3

Five percent of tablets made by the company Ixian have factory defects. Ten percent of the tablets made by their competitor company Guild do. A computer store buys 40% of its tablets from Ixian, and 60% from Guild.

a. What is the probability a randomly selected tablet in the store is made by Ixian and has a factory defect?
b. What is the probability a randomly selected tablet in the store has a factory defect?
c. What is the probability a tablet from this store is made by Ixian, given that it has a factory defect?
