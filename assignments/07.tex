  What is the probability of \(A\wedge\left(B\wedge\neg A\right)\)?

  What is the probability of \(\neg\left(A\wedge\neg A\right)\)?
\item
  True or False: If propositions are independent, they must be mutually
  exclusive.
\item
  True or False: Independent propositions usually aren't mutually
  exclusive.
\item
  True or False: If propositions are mutually exclusive, then they must
  be independent.
\item
  True or False: Mutually exclusive propositions usually aren't
  independent.
\item
  Assume \(\text{Pr}\left(A\wedge B\right)=\nicefrac{1}{3}\) and
  \(\text{Pr}\left(A\wedge\neg B\right)=\nicefrac{1}{5}\). Say (in
  decimal form, to two decimal places), what is
  \(\text{Pr}\left(\left(A\wedge B\right)\vee\left(A\wedge\neg B\right)\right)\).

\item
  Assume \(\text{Pr}\left(A\wedge B\right)=\nicefrac{1}{3}\) and
  \(\text{Pr}\left(A\wedge\neg B\right)=\nicefrac{1}{5}\). Are
  \(\left(A\wedge B\right)\) and \(\left(A\wedge\neg B\right)\)
  independent?
\item
  Suppose \(A\) and \(B\) are independent, and \(A\) and \(C\) are
  mutually exclusive. Assume
  \(\Pr(A) = \nicefrac{1}{3}, \Pr(B) = \nicefrac{1}{6}\) and
  \(\Pr(C) = \nicefrac{1}{9}\). What (to two decimal places) is
  \(\Pr(A \wedge C)\)?

\item
  True or False: If \(\Pr(A) = \Pr(B)\) then \(A\) and \(B\) must be
  logically equivalent.
\item
  Consider this argument. \emph{If a coin is fair, then the probability
  of getting at least one heads in a sequence of four tosses is quite
  high: above 90\%. Therefore, if a fair coin has landed tails three
  times in a row, the next toss will probably land heads.} True or
  False: The premise of the argument is true.

  Five percent of tablets made by the company Ixian have factory
  defects. Ten percent of the tablets made by their competitor company
  Guild do. A computer store buys 40\% of its tablets from Ixian, and
  60\% from Guild. What is the probability a randomly selected tablet in
  the store is made by Ixian and has a factory defect?
