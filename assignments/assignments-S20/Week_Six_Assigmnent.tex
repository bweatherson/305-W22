\newpage

For each of the following arguments, I want you to find substitution instances for $A, B$ and (if necessary) $C$ to make the arguments intuitively have true premises and a false conclusion. In most cases there are examples of these in the textbook or the slides - you \textbf{must} use your own versions, not those. If you need to explain the background to the examples, you can do that as well in the text boxes provided.

\subsection*{Question 16}
\begin{enumerate*}
\item If it were the case that $A$, it would be the case that $B$.
\item So, if it were the case that $C \wedge A$, it would be the case that $B$.
\end{enumerate*}

\subsection*{Question 17}
\begin{enumerate*}
\item If it will be the case that $A$, it will be the case that $B$.
\item So, if it will the case that $C \wedge A$, it will be the case that $B$.
\end{enumerate*}

\subsection*{Question 18}
\begin{enumerate*}
\item If it was be the case that $A$, it was be the case that $B$.
\item So, if it was the case that $C \wedge A$, it was be the case that $B$.
\end{enumerate*}

\subsection*{Question 19}
\begin{enumerate*}
\item If it were the case that $A$, it would be the case that $B$.
\item If it were the case that $B$, it would be the case that $C$.
\item So, if it were the case that $A$, it would be the case that $C$.
\end{enumerate*}

\subsection*{Question 20}
\begin{enumerate*}
\item If it were the case that $A$, it would be the case that $B \vee C$.
\item So \textit{either}, if it were the case that $A$, it would be the case that $B$, \textit{or}, if it were the case that $A$, it would be the case that $C$.
\end{enumerate*}
