\subsection{Odds and Ends 9.1 (with one extra
question)}\label{odds-and-ends-9.1-with-one-extra-question}}

Willy Wonka Co.~makes two kinds of boxes of chocolates. The ``wonk box''
has four caramel chocolates and six regular chocolates. The ``zonk box''
has six caramel chocolates, two regular chocolates, and two mint
chocolates. A third of their boxes are wonk boxes, the rest are zonk
boxes.

They don't mark the boxes. The only way to tell what kind of box you've
bought is by trying the chocolates inside. In fact, all the chocolates
look the same; you can only tell the difference by tasting them.

If you buy a random box, try a chocolate at random, and find that it's
caramel, what is the probability you've bought a wonk box?

Now suppose you randomly select \textbf{two} chocolates.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  What is the probability it's a wonk box given that both chocolates are
  caramel?
\item
  What is the probability it's a wonk box given that the first is
  caramel and the second is regular?
\item
  What is the probability it's a wonk box given that the first is
  regular and the second is caramel?
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{marbles}{%
\subsection{Marbles}\label{marbles}}

Suppose I have an even mix of black and white marbles. I choose one at
random without letting you see the colour, and I put it in a hat.

Then I add a second, black marble to the hat. If I draw one marble at
random from the hat and it's black, what is the probability the marble
left in the hat is black?

\hypertarget{odds-and-ends-8.5-and-9.2}{%
\subsection{Odds and Ends 8.5 and 9.2}\label{odds-and-ends-8.5-and-9.2}}

A magic shop sells two kinds of trick coins. The first kind are biased
towards heads: they come up heads 9 times out of 10 (the tosses are
independent). The second kind are biased towards tails: they comes up
tails 8 times out of 10 (tosses still independent). Half the coins are
the first kind, half are the second kind. But they don't label the
coins, so you have to experiment to find out which are which.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  You pick a coin at random and flip it once. Given that it comes up
  heads, what is the probability it's the first kind of coin?
\item
  If you flip the coin twice, and it lands heads both times, what is the
  probability that it is the first kind of coin?
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{odds-and-ends-8.12-and-9.4}{%
\subsection{Odds and Ends 8.12 and
9.4}\label{odds-and-ends-8.12-and-9.4}}

A room contains four urns. Three of them are Type X, one is Type Y.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The Type X urns each contain 3 black marbles, 2 white marbles.
\item
  The Type Y urn contains 1 black marble, 4 white marbles.
\end{itemize}

You are going to pick an urn at random and start drawing marbles from it
at random without replacement.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What is the probability the urn is Type X if the first draw is black?
\end{itemize}

Now you are going to draw two marbles without replacement. (Note I'm
skipping question b.)

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  What is the probability the urn is Type X if the first draw is black
  and the second is white? \setcounter{enumi}{2}
\item
  What is the probability the third draw will be black, if the first
  draw is black and the second is white?
\end{enumerate}
