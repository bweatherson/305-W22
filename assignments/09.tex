\subsection{Question 1}\label{question-1}}

What is the expected monetary value of playing a slot machine that costs
\$100 to play, and has a 1/25 chance of paying out \$500? (The rest of
the time it pays nothing.)

\hypertarget{question-2}{%
\subsection{Question 2}\label{question-2}}

Suppose a slot machine pays off \$25 a fiftieth of the time and costs a
\$1 to play, and a video poker machine pays off \$10 a twentieth of the
time and costs \$2 to play. Which machine is the better bet in terms of
expected monetary value?

\hypertarget{question-3}{%
\subsection{Question 3}\label{question-3}}

Youʼre considering downloading a new game for your phone. The game costs
\$0.99. But as a promotion, the first 50,000 downloaders are being
entered in a fair lottery with a \$10,000 cash prize. If you know youʼll
be one of the first 50,000 downloaders, what is the expected monetary
value of downloading the game?

\hypertarget{question-4}{%
\subsection{Question 4}\label{question-4}}

A local casino offers a game which costs \$2 to play. A fair coin is
flipped up to three times, and the payouts work as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If the coin lands heads on the first toss, you win \$2 and the game is
  over.
\item
  If the coin lands heads on the second toss, you win \$4 and the game
  is over.
\item
  If the coin lands heads on the third toss, you win \$8 and the game is
  over.
\item
  If the coin lands tails all three times, you win \$0.
\end{itemize}

What is the expected monetary value of the game?

\hypertarget{question-5}{%
\subsection{Question 5}\label{question-5}}

Suppose you can bet on either of two dogs: Santaʼs Little Helper or
Sheʼs the Fastest. If you bet on Santaʼs Little Helper and he wins, you
get \$5. If he loses you pay \$2. If you bet on Sheʼs the Fastest and
she loses, you pay \$10. The two dogs have the same chance of winning.
How much would a winning bet on Sheʼs the Fastest have to pay for the
bets to have the same value? (Assume one or other of the dogs is
guaranteed to win).

\hypertarget{question-6}{%
\subsection{Question 6}\label{question-6}}

Suppose Michigan is deciding whether to enact a new tax. If the tax is
enacted, it will bring in \$700 million in revenue.

But it could also hurt the economy. The chance of harm to the economy is
small, just 1/5. But it would cost the country \$1,200 million in lost
earnings. (The \$700 million in revenue would still be gained, partially
offsetting this loss.)

Treat gains as positive and losses as negative.

What is the expected monetary value of enacting the new tax?

(Answer in millions of dollars. So if the answer is \$700 million, write
700.)

\hypertarget{question-7}{%
\subsection{Question 7}\label{question-7}}

Extend question 6 in the following way. The government has the option of
conducting a study before deciding whether to enact the new tax. If the
study's findings are bad news, that means the chance of harm to the
economy is actually double what they thought. If its findings are good
news, then the chance of harm to the economy is actually half of what
they thought.

Suppose the government conducts the study and its findings are good
news. What will the expected monetary value of enacting the tax be then?

(Answer in millions of dollars. So if the answer is \$700 million, write
700.)

\hypertarget{question-8}{%
\subsection{Question 8}\label{question-8}}

Suppose the government conducts the study in question 7 and its findings
are bad news. What will the expected monetary value of enacting the tax
be then?

\hypertarget{question-9}{%
\subsection{Question 9}\label{question-9}}

If the expected monetary value of the tax is what you said in question
6, and the study is bound to deliver good news or bad news, what is the
probability of it delivering good news?

\hypertarget{question-10}{%
\subsection{Question 10}\label{question-10}}

Consider the following game: I'm going to flip a fair coin up to three
times. If it comes up heads on the first toss, the game is over and you
win \$2. If it comes up heads for the first time on the second toss, you
win \$40 and the game is over. If the first heads comes up on the third
toss, you win \$800 and the game is over. If it comes up tails every
time, you have to pay me \$x.

What does x have to be to make the game fair?

(Don't worry about the difference between money and utility here - fair
just means the expected monetary value of the game is 0)
